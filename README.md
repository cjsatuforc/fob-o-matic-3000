The Fob-O-Matic 3000

At my favorite Hackerspace, Ace Monster Toys (https://www.acemonstertoys.org/), members get 24x7 access using their fob.

When a new member wants to join the community, we need an easy way to assign them a fob. Our fobs are pre-bundled in
individual enveloppes with the sign-in instructions. This tool is a simple project that allows us to quickly get the fob
number when we are preparing a batch of keys.

The box was 3D printed and designed for this project. 

Parts list :
 - 1 Arduino Uno R3 (https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Uno-R3-Microcontroller-A000066/dp/B008GRTSV6)
