The Fob-O-Matic 3000

At my favorite Hackerspace, Ace Monster Toys (https://www.acemonstertoys.org/), members get 24x7 access using their fob.

When a new member wants to join the community, we need an easy way to assign them a fob. Our fobs are pre-bundled in
individual enveloppes with the sign-in instructions. This tool is a simple project that allows us to quickly get the fob
number when we are preparing a batch of keys.

The box was 3D printed and designed around an Arduino Uno R3, a cheap Oled display (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O2LLT30) and a
Parallax RFID reader (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B88HFPG).
